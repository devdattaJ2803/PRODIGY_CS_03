# Password Complexity Checker

This repository contains a password complexity checker tool as part of my Cyber Security Internship. The tool assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Contents

- `password_checker_gui.py`: A Python script that provides a GUI for checking password strength.
- `README.md`: Documentation and details about the project.

## Features

- **Password Strength Evaluation**: Assesses the strength of a password based on multiple criteria.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly GUI for entering passwords and viewing results.
- **Detailed Feedback**: Offers feedback on how to improve password strength.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Python Script**:
   - Execute the `password_checker_gui.py` script to launch the GUI application:
     ```bash
     python password_checker_gui.py
     ```

2. **Interact with the GUI**:
   - Enter a password in the entry field.
   - Click the "Check Password" button to see the strength result and feedback.

## Learning Outcomes

- Implemented a password complexity checker in Python.
- Created a GUI application using `tkinter`.
- Provided detailed feedback to users on how to improve password strength.
